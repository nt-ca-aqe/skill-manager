== API Root

The `/api` root resource returns information about available API endpoints in the form of `application/hal+json` links:

include::{snippets}/api/get/ok/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/api/get/ok/http-response.adoc[]

Please take a look at the link:employees/api.html[_employees_], link:projects/api.html[_projects_] and link:skills/api.html[_skills_] API documentation files for a detailed description of each of the available resources for those domains.
The GraphQL endpoint is shared between all domains.
The available operations for each domain are described in their respective API documentation files.
